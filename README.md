#CONNECTING RUNNERS

It's a web app built with Node.js & Express.js server, Basically allows runners to find more people to train with, people can create an account and create an event such as "run 10K in the Retiro Park, pace 5 min/km" and people could join to your event.

Original idea by Clementina Mata and Maria Camila Maya Salas 
Developed as 2nd project in the Ironhack's full stack bootcamp Madrid
